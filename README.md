# A Perfectly Adequate Image Gallery Generator - Written in Golang

A dog simple image gallery generator written in Golang that generates stupid simple html for your image galleries.

Easy stuff. Throw some images in the input.

Then, go to the command line, and enter `go run main.go`
And then wait for however long it takes, and then you're there.

Output magically appears, ready for upload in the output directory.

You're going to want to adjust the template, to personalize it, it's so simple it's barely there, but that's easy too.
There's only one template, and my best guess is that you can at least get by with html and javascript if you're reading this.

Take care
